    "# CS 237 Lab Three: Poker Probability\n",
    "In this lab we will explore Poker Probability, which is calculating the probability of various hands in the game of poker. This is, again, exploring how to confirm our theoretical understanding with experiments. If our experiments, as we increase the number of trials, converge to our theoretical calculation, then we have almost certainly analyzed it correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many versions of poker (see <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Play-Poker\">here</a>) but the game we will study is called \"five-card draw.\" It is <a href=\"https://www.pokernews.com/strategy/5-card-draw-rules-how-to-play-five-card-draw-poker-23741.htm\">described</a> as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>Once everyone has paid the ante, each player receives five cards face down. A round of betting then occurs. If more than one player remains after that first round of betting, there follows a first round of drawing. Each active player specifies how many cards he or she wishes to discard and replace with new cards from the deck. If you are happy with your holding and do not want to draw any cards, you “stand pat.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the drawing round is completed, there is another round of betting. After that if there is more than one player remaining, a showdown occurs in which the player with the best five-card poker hand wins.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "The only part we will care about is the final calculation of which hand wins: basically, the least probable hand wins.  When you learn poker, then, one of the first things you have to learn is the ordering of the hands from most to least likely. <i>Poker probability</i> refers to calculating the exact probabilities of hands. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_probability\">Wikipedia article</a> contains the exact results and the formulae used to calculate them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will develop a framework for dealing 5-card hands and empirically estimating the probabilites of various hands. In fact, we will be able to do nearly all the hands commonly encountered. Our only constraint is that for the two rarest hands, the probability is so small it would take too long to get a reasonable estimate, and so we shall ignore them. \n",
    "\n",
    "This should complete your understanding of the counting techniques covered in lecture. "

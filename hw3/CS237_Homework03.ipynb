    "(Inclusion/Exclusion, Change of Representation) The elevator of a four-floor building leaves the first floor with six passengers and stops at all of the remaining three floors. If it is equally likely that a passenger gets off at any of these three floors, what is the probability that, at each stop of the elevator, at least one passenger departs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: This is a problem in which you need to exercise your creativity by considering a change of representation. Instead of focussing on the sequence of floors and who gets off on them, focus on the sequence of passengers and what floor they get off on, e.g., 111111 means all passengers got off at floor 1, and 133332 means passenger 1 got off at 1, passenger 6 got off at 2, and the rest at 3. Then use Inclusion/Exclusion."

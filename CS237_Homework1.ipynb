When they get the exam, it consists of two problems, the first (worth 5%) a simple problem from the course, and the second (worth 95%) consists of the single question \"Which tire was it?\" If the students have a 10% probability of actually having had a flat tire, then what is their chance of passing the exam? Assume a score of 95 is passing. Assume that if they didn't have a flat tire, they have to guess randomly at the exam, and if they did indeed have a flat time, they would both remember which one.

To answer this, perform N = 10^6 trials (each of which consists of flipping the coin 4 times and recording how many heads appear). Keep track of the results in an array X = [0]\\*5 (you need 5 totals for each of K = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Then divide each of these 5 totals by N = 10^6 to obtain the probability of each K.

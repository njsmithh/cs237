Write a function randomness_test1(N) which tests this assumption, i.e., declare a list X = [0]\\*10 which will record how many times each of the digits 0 .. 9 is generated in 10^6 calls to randint(....), and prints out the array X at the end. \n",

    "The objective in each round of the game is to score as close to 21 as possible by rolling a die as many times as you wish and adding all the numbers that appear. When a player's total exceeds 21, he is 'busted' and gets 0 points. If the player chooses to stop rolling before he exceeds 21, then the sum of the numbers rolled in that round is the number of points he wins. (There are many variations on this game, some involving multiple players, or a \"banker\" or different numbers of dice, or alcohol..... here is a short YT video explaining the basic game.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer can play this game with a suitable strategy. For this problem, we will consider a strategy to be simply an integer K which is the value at which you stop rolling (thinking that you are close enough to 21). The number K is fixed for the entire game. For example, if you set K = 19, then in every round, you will keep rolling if your sum to that point is less than or equal to 19; if you get more than 19 you stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should write a function playRound(K) which rolls a single die until you reach K or get busted, and either return your score (if you reached K), or 0 (if you were busted). Then write a function playGame() which calls playRound(K) for N = 10^6 times for each K and returns an array of 21 numbers giving the average payoff for each K = 1, ..., 21.\n",

    "\n",
    "- For each K = 1 .. 21, what is the average payoff per round for a game played with this strategy?\n",
    "- What is the best strategy for the game, meaning what value of K wins the most points on average?"
